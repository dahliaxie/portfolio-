<h1>About Me!</h1>
<p>My name is Dahlia Xie. I'm 16 and my birthday is on september 23rd, 2000. I'm an incoming senior at the International School in Bellevue (I'm not from a different country through, that's just the name of the school). My school is a combined middle school and high school with only about 700 students and less than 100 students in each grade.  I do gymnastics and pole vault at Newport High School because my school does not have sport teams.</p>

  
<p> Likes: cats, music, gymnastics, hiking, sneakers, mac and cheese, lemonade, and going on spontaneous trips <p/>
<p> Dislikes:
